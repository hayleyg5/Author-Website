    <h1>Two Kingdoms (Currently Querying)</h1>
    <p>
		As the third-born princess, Rya Jhone has known her whole life that she would not inherit either throne of the two kingdoms. She’d marry the third-born prince, and sail away in search of new lands to explore and add to her map.
		<br>
		But when her eldest sister’s engagement is delayed, Rya begins to wonder if the future she had always envisioned for herself has ever been what she really dreamed about.
		<br>
		And when the royal family of a long-lost kingdom comes to visit and ally with the two kingdoms, Rya seems to be the only one to uncover the lies they’ve been spreading—only to become entangled within them herself.
		<br>
		With the help of a few unlikely allies, Rya will fight for her homeland and for the truth to finally come to light—even if it means facing the lies she’s told herself.

	<h1>I Leave the End To You (Short Story Competition Entry)</h1>
	<p>
		In March of 2021, I entered a short story competition through Vocal.media and wrote a story about a little black book. I didn’t win the $20,000 first-place prize, but much like my character Ellis in that story, I stumbled upon something better that I hadn’t known I’d been looking for, and rediscovered my love of writing. 
		<br>
		You can read about the unpredictable Ms. Steiner, her very distant relative Ellis, and the strange select-your-own inheritance that led to an inconceivable partnership here.
